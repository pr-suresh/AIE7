This caused their balances to grow over time, making it difficult to pay off the loans and leading to larger total debt.\\n\\n2. **Limited and Unfavorable Repayment Options:** Borrowers were often only offered options like forbearance or deferment, which did not reduce the overall debt but allowed interest to accumulate. Lowering monthly payments was sometimes unaffordable, and increasing payments to accelerate payoff was not feasible for many.\\n\\n3. **Lack of Clear Communication or Transparency:** Some borrowers were not properly notified about transfers between loan servicers, initiation of repayment, or changes in their payment status. This lack of information led to missed payments, delinquencies, or defaults.\\n\\n4. **Financial Hardships and Economic Conditions:** Borrowers faced financial hardships, stagnant wages, and economic downturns, which made it impossible to keep up with payments, especially when combined with rising interest and lack of income-based repayment options.\\n\\n5. **Mismanagement and Poor Servicing Practices:** Complaints included issues like loans being transferred without proper notification, inability to apply payments to principal, or being subject to predatory repayment schemes, which further hindered repayment efforts.\\n\\n6. **Unclear or Incorrect Information and Debt Disputes:** Some borrowers discovered discrepancies in their account balances and interest calculations, and lacked access to documentation or breakdowns explaining their debt, leading to confusion and difficulty in managing repayment.\\n\\nIn summary, the combination of rising interest, insufficient communication, limited flexible repayment options, economic hardship, and servicing issues contributed to many people's inability to pay back their loans.\""
